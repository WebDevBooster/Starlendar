# Starlendar: a calendar system for Star City

This new calendar system is designed for use in Star City (see Star City manifesto). So, we don't expect anyone else to adopt this calendar. But anyone who wishes to do so is welcome to. 

The primary purpose of this calendar system is to do just one thing: 

### The Why (separate the "chaff from the wheat")

By "chaff" in this case I mean all the individuals attached to the dogma of major organized religions. 

This calendar change is a simple and super-effective way to filter those people out. They will filter themselves out. Simply because we'll implement this new calendar in Star City. Starlendar will keep all those nutcases away from our city. Here's why: 

1) Individuals attached to the dogma of major organized religions (I won't mention any by name) firmly believe that there's something "divine" about a 7-day week. No, there isn't. Their core belief system is structured around the week having 7 days. And they assign various religious meanings to various days of a 7-day week. In their worldview, a week cannot have anything other than 7 days.

2) Their reliance on a 7-day week is so great that a system without a 7-day week would be completely unacceptable to them. They wouldn't even entertain a thought of living in a world without a 7-day week. Perfect!

That's why I designed Starlendar. 

### The How

I originally conceived this new calendar system back in September 2013. Its original main purpose was to "separate the chaff from the wheat" by doing 2 things: 

1) Implement a 6-day week.

2) Restart the year count.

Restarting the year count is another crucial element of Starlendar. Because the currently most popular calendar system — the Gregorian calendar — has a start date to which many organized religions assign huge significance. 

Nevermind the fact that pope Gregory who commissioned that calendar failed to realize that skipping year 0 is an idiotic thing to do. Think about it... every person is zero years old when they are born. And they become one year old after one year of being alive. And yet, in the Gregorian calendar there's NO year zero. So, what? Did that person who has great significance in many religions instantly become one year old after birth?

That's why skipping year 0 is just plain idiotic. The fact that the Gregorian calendar skips the year 0 is a hint that nobody really knows when that "person" was born or whether he ever existed in the first place. The whole thing is a myth and the Gregorian calendar was designed to perpetuate that myth. 

In Star City we do NOT want to use a calendar system that was commissioned by a pope. We do NOT want to perpetuate the myths that pope Gregory wanted to perpetuate by commissioning the design of that calendar.

But even more importantly: 

Because the start of the Gregorian calendar has such great significance in many organized religions (their faith is literally tied to that start), simply just restarting the year count in an arbitrary year, will be unacceptable to people affected by the dogma. Perfect! 

2011 was the year when I started working on the Star City project. So, I decided to pick that year as year 0 for Starlendar. 

Originally, I wanted the year start in Starlendar to be on 11/11 of 2011 i.e. 11 November 2011. Just having fun with numbers. 

But recently I stumbled upon a thing called [World Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Calendar). Reading through that Wikipedia page made me realize: We don't really need to start our calendar at an odd date like the 11/11. World Calendar was a much less radical reform proposal to the Gregorian calendar and yet the religious nutters have successfully killed it. 

So, given that Starlendar is a much more radical change compared to World Calendar, we can be sure that even if we synchronize the year start (and leap years) with the Gregorian calendar, it will work great for filtering out religious nutcases from Star City. Awesome! 

Also, reading through that Wikipedia page about World Calendar made me realize that... even though World Calendar was a more benign reform proposal (compared to Starlendar), apparently many people and countries were seriously considering World Calendar implementation because of the various benefits listed on that Wikipedia page. 

In other words, on top of fulfilling its main purpose outlined above Starlendar would also give us those same benefits that World Calendar was expected to provide. A BONUS! 

It's a bonus I hadn't even considered when developing Starlendar. But hey, we'll take it! :-)
